Scene notes:
* There are no "windows" to speak of in this facility. Only window-like, sun-colored LED squares.
* The courtyard in the middle does indeed have a "sun" at the top, against a fake sky. It dims at night.
	* This is because 1) this is a secret facility and 2) "outside" is pretty barren anyway, so at this point in the story that should not be revealed.
* Need to add references -- even if just visual -- to お父さん's character (Friedrich Gustav Emanuel von Braun) holding and scribbling in the brown leather-bound journal. He uses it to record his observations for his work *and* as a record of growth to Kinari. When he hands it to her, it's got a letter from him written inside it.

"That's right, Kinari! Just like that! Good job!" 
 
Words of praise brought a smile to the girl's face. She was, with great difficulty, attempting to walk -- supporting herself with railings on either side. They were in a room filled with various small obstacles, medical beds, styrofoam cylinders, and large, round balancing balls.

As Maria praised her on, she attempted a few more times. 

After about 10 attempts, Maria placed various obstacles on the path.

"There. Can you hop over the obstacles?"

The girl nervously nodded, and proceeded to jump. Her first jump was awkward, and she didn't move forward. She tilted her head to the side, looking puzzled, as if her body didn't move as she expected.

Maria laughs. "You've got to jump like this -- here, watch me."

Maria stands at the other end of the railed walkway and holds the railings, jumping over the first obstacle. 

"See?"

Then, she lets go of the railings, and jumps over the next obstacle. She stands there.

"Like this! Now, you try!"

Kinari jumps over the first obstacle successfully, supporting herself by holding the railings. 

Looking down, she furrows her brow and lets go of the railings. Swinging her arms back, she jumps forward like she had seen Maria do. She jumped over another obstacle, and then another, and then...

... Thud!

"...Oh!"

The girl hits her head on something. That *something* lets out a sound.

"Ah...!"

She looks up. It's Maria.

「ご、ごめんなさい！」

「いいのよ！はっはっは！」

大きくて優しく包んでくれるような声で笑う研究者。

「よくできたわね、キナリちゃん！というか、大丈夫？…痛くはない？」

*「痛くはない？」* という不適切な自分の言葉を不満そうに思うように、少し首を傾げ、口を尖らせる。

「…うん！」

無邪気に笑う二人。まるで母と子供のよう。

「次、進もうね！」

... This goes on for hours. Maria will show the girl various movements, stretches, and ways to control her body. The girl learns fast. After a while, she moves with no problems at all. As they continue, Maria begins to explain what is happening inside their bodies as they are moving.

--

After a while longer, Maria stretches her hands upward and exhales deeply.

"Phew! I'm tired now. How are you feeling, Kinari?"

"I'm having fun! Thank you, Maria."

She smiles brightly.

「よし！いいぞー！じゃー、私はお腹が減ったからお昼休憩をするけど、きなりちゃんはお父さんを探す？」

「うんっ！」

「オッケー！一緒に探しましょう！」

The two of them walk through the bright white corridors of the research facility.

Passing by each room, they peek in the doors to see if Otou-san is there.

All of the people smile and wave at Kinari. They all look at her with great fondness.

…結局、お父さんを見つけられなかった。

諦めた少女が女性の研究者と一緒に食堂に行く。

見回りながら椅子に座って待っている少女。少し騒がしい食堂。大勢の白衣を着た人たちがご飯を食べたり、コーヒーを飲みながら喋ったりしている。

// There, Kinari sits and waits happily as Maria gets food. They chat while Maria eats, and some of Maria's friends come over to talk and drink coffee. One of them makes a remark about Kinari that is a bit insensitive, something like "It would be nice if you could make it so she could eat too!" which makes Kinari wonder silently why she can't eat like all the other people around her (obvious to the reader because she is *not one of them*, despite everyone treating her no differently than a human).

// after study with Pierre going back to her room she runs into Otou san, coming out of a room. He looks surprised to see her and greets her warmly, patting her head. She peeks into the room for a moment, tall, wide-chested man in a dark green suit unlike anything she had ever seen before. He had stern, cold eyes, and his mouth was stuck in a frown. He was standing behind a desk, leaning slightly forward and resting his hands on its surface. He looked almost like a tiger that she had seen in one of Pierre's picture-books, getting ready to leap forward and eat some small animal. キナリの方を見た。体が突き刺されるような感覚を覚え、鳥肌がたった。キナリが早く目を逸らし、お父さんの方を見た。

たった1秒すら目を合わせていないというのに、何分も経ったように感じた。

でも、お父さんはすぐそばに居た。自分も、お父さんも、無事だった。
そして、あの怖い人と違って、お父さんは笑顔だった。

「お、お父さんはまだお仕事？」

「んー、そうだね…」

He casts an uneasy look towards the room. The big, scary man looks at Otou-san, and then at Kinari. 残念そうな目でキナリを見た。

"Von Braun..." the man calls out to Otou-san.

Otou-san turns back and looks at the man.

"I'm counting on you. ... We're all counting on you."

Otou-san smiles slightly and nods.

The man nods back.

お父さんが喋り出した。

「…今日はもう仕事が終わりだよ！さぁ、お家帰りましょう！」

He task the small girl's hand and they begin to walk together. 

The girl looks up at Maria, who is walking besides them.

「私は少し仕事が残っているので、ここに居るよ！また明日、キナリちゃん！」

「うん！」少女が頷く。

「ご苦労さん、マリア。」

マリアが手を振り、廊下の逆方向に歩き出す。

キナリとお父さんも歩き出した。

すると、あの怖い人が最後にキナリを見た表情を思い出す。あの残念そうな目。

*キナリは、何か悪いことでもしたのかな…？いつもお勉強を頑張って、ピアノやバレエだって頑張っているのに…でも、やっぱりあの人のこと、知らない！絶対に、キナリは悪くない！*

結局その人の表情が理解できなかった。理解しなくていいという判断をした。

--

The two walk through the corridors and eventually exit the gates of the research facility, into a large courtyard, surrounded by many floors of apartments, whose entrances are connected by circular walkways and glass railings. The courtyard is completely enclosed, save for the giant gates connected to the research facility.

In the center is a garden, filled with various trees, chirping birds, and gently whispering streams of water.

A bright light pours in from overhead.

Suddenly, the evening chime starts to play. The bright light starts to dim slightly, changing into a warmer color, a mixture of orange and pink.

The girl looks up towards the light.

Otou-san looks down at her.

The orange and pink light swirled within her green eyes, lighting them afire.

He looks relieved. He holds her hand tightly.

The girl turns to him, and tilts her head.

He smiles and says nothing.

The girl stands up straight.

「さあ、お家帰ろう！お父さん！」

「そうだね。」

戸惑うように立ち止まる男。

「いつか、もっと綺麗な空を見せるよ、キナリ。」

「もっと綺麗なお空？そんなお空があるんだね、お父さん！」

「あるよ、キナリ。もう少し大きくなってから、ね。もう少し待ってて。」

「わー」

見上げながら大きく口を開く少女。

そして、二人が住む階まで運んでくれるガラスのエレベーターに向かう。
