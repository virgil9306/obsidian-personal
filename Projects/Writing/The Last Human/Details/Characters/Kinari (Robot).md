### メモ
- She is an android
- She is treated like a daughter by [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]]
- Modeled after the deceased daughter of [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]]
	- She contains the "original" Kinari's memories and other traits, giving her very human-like characteristics, including "yawning" and "becoming sleepy", as well as retaining [[Kinari (Human)]]'s favorite foods (ハンバーグ, among other things), despite not being able to truly taste (she can analyze composition through taste-bud-like sensors, and make predictive assessments of "taste").
		- These are leftover behaviors, rather than mimicking humans. Psychologically, she essentially "feels" these things.
	- Using human memories as a basis for intelligence was researched and developed by [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]] as a way to arrive at AGI. Thus she is the first AGI in a sense.
- She is tasked with the mission of making contact with aliens to procure long-term technological assistance on behalf of her country's military, which has reached a stalemate with the other global superpower (there are 2), lasting decades (and projected to last hundreds of years)
- The military brass don't like her because they wanted [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]] to build a Terminator-like robot instead for the mission
	- But the developed robot ended up being Kinari after [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]] developed AGI technology through snapshotting his deceased daughter's memories (this process was not done for other humans), so the military brass begrudgingly had to accept that this was the only capable robot/AI for their mission
