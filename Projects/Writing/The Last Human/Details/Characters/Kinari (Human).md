### メモ
- The deceased (age 7) daughter of [[Otousan - von Braun, Friedrich Gustav Emanuel]] and his wife Elise.
	- She perished in a tragic car accident: a drunk truck driver ran on the wrong side of the road
- From a young age, her father performed experiments on her, essentially "capturing" her memories, her essence, her *soul*, across a vast array of parameters. These parameters were later used to infuse a specialized AI, thereby creating AGI. That AI was then housed inside a humanoid robot: [[Kinari (Robot)]]
