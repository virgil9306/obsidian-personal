### メモ
* お父さん's full name is Friedrich Gustav Emanuel von Braun (from the name, it's implied that he is a very far descendant of Wernher von Braun)
* His wife (deceased) was named Elise. She died when they were still young.
* They had a daughter, who died at the same time as Elise.
* He used some of her memories (soul) as a basis for Kinari: 
	1) to accelerate her growth and ability to be an AGI, 
		* knowing it's for the sake of humanity, since in this universe, AGI was not considered possible
			* However Friedrich achieves this by developing the technology for memory/soul snapshotting
	2) because he is trying to fill the void left by the death of his daughter, Kinari, with a substitute

	* He has glasses, and the hairline of his gray-white hair is somewhat receding
	* He has wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, from smiling
	* His forehead has wrinkle lines
	* He has a moustache
