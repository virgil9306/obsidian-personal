* Beginning with Act 1, Chapter 1
	*  Need to add references -- even if just visual -- to お父さん's character holding and scribbling in the brown leather-bound journal. He uses it to record his observations for his work *and* as a record of growth to Kinari. When he hands it to her, it's got a letter from him written inside it.

* Why are they sending Kinari and the Alcubierre Capsule up to LEO in a rocket
	* As camouflage to not let the enemy know they have advanced alien technology (the Alcubierre Capsule was developed with alien technology retrieved from a UFO crash site, which is where the superpower government discovered the aliens and want to seek help from them)
	* Because it's practical: it gets the job done and they can use leftover rockets from ICBMs. They don't launch anything to space anymore because of Kessler Syndrome, so they have no use for rockets that go to space.

* Kinari's birthday
	* Her "family" surprises her with a birthday surprise. However, Kinari is confused, and tilts her head. Everyone is confused at Kinari's surprise. "Birthday...? But it's not my birthday!" "What do you mean? You were born exactly on this day, 5 years ago!" "But my birthday isn't for another 33 minutes, 42 seconds and 15 milliseconds!" "Well, then that means the birthday surprise was a success! It wouldn't be a surprise birthday party if you were expecting it, now would it!" This demonstrates her quirkiness: she's *not* human even if she acts very human.

* Alcubierre Drive

* Communication technology with Earth from space
	* Quantum entanglement-based communication system (of course, this would not work in reality)

* Dream sequences
	* The world of the dreams is essentially the world after her "death" and burial by the aliens.
	* It symbolizes the aliens re-seeding the earth, after the humans destroyed it (while fighting amongst themselves).
	* It will NEVER be revealed explicitly in the story that the aliens do this, but only implied symbolically through her eyes in dream sequences, as if the aliens are showing her (by sending dreams to her, back in time) that everything will be okay. 
	* Kinari, however, sees the dreams and doesn't know what to make of them. But, they are reassuring, even if mysterious. 
	* By the time she falls asleep for the last time (before her systems are shut down permanently), the dreams will have concluded, showing her the complete visions -- at least as far as the aliens needed to show her -- of her home planet after her death
	* When she sees "herself" dead in the dream sequences, it will be as a small child. This represents that it's actually the "real" Kinari (Otou-san's biological child who died with Elise)
