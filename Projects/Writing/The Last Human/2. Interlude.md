… Ever since mankind first emerged, he has looked to the stars for guidance.

To navigate the stormy oceans. To determine his fate. To find his true love. To understand more about himself and the world.

Yet as he evolved, as towns and cities and megacities developed and spread, as the world outside them became increasingly barren and hostile, drained of their resources and left neglected, he grew unable to see them. Unable to consult them. Unable to appreciate them. And his ignorance grew. He grew prideful. He believed himself to be a master of his own fate and a master of the universe and all matter therein, for he could no longer see how small he was among all of the heavens.

As this hubris grew, he eventually learned that his ways would not last. And rather than seek out peaceful coexistence, he fought bloody wars among his brothers, who would steal from each other instead of uplifting one another. All brothers and sisters, orbiting the same star, divided by ideology about who gets what, and who gets to survive on what little remains.

… And once again, not out of reverence, but out of desperation, mankind looks to the stars for salvation. Stars that now, he can only see through the images beamed back to earth by so many machines.
