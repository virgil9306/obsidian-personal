### Approach to Streaming (Paused)

- **Build your audience first**:
    - Post a few more videos before starting live streaming.

- **Hikigatari strategy**:
    - Use hikigatari to help with performance anxiety, audience building, and improving skills, even if you don’t enjoy it.
    - Recognize that the songs for hikigatari might differ from your ideal performances.
    - Understand this will help you develop two “personalities” for streaming versus polished content.

- **Live stream for engagement**:
    - Focus live streams on talking to people, getting to know your audience, and helping them with English lyrics or artistic advice.
