#### My songwriting process
    
    (Cleaned up by ChatGPT)
    
    ### Overall Structure:
    
    1. **Concept and Flow**: Determine the overall structure and flow of the song, including how the story progresses or the message gets transmitted.
    
    ### Initial Composition:
    
    1. **Chords for Rhythm Guitar**: Establish the basic chord progression for the rhythm guitar.
    2. **Chord Changes**: Ensure smooth transitions between chords.
    3. **Strumming Patterns**: Develop the strumming patterns for the rhythm guitar.
    4. **Drum Plan**: Write down where you want different drum patterns and fills, using EZdrummer later to flesh them out.
    5. **Basic Bass Line**: Create a basic bass line following the root notes of the chords.
    
    ### Song Flesh-Out:
    
    1. **Melody Line for Lead Guitar**: Develop the melody lines for the lead guitar in bridges, verses, and motifs. 6.5. **Keyboard Parts**: Add keyboard chords, melodies, arpeggios, etc., to complement the guitar parts and add depth.
    2. **Vocal Structure**: Outline the basic vocal structure, focusing on the notes and overall melody without lyrics yet.
    3. **Guitar Solo**: Plan and write the guitar solo if the song includes one.
    
    ### Refinement:
    
    1. **Advanced Bass Line**: Flesh out the bass line, adding more complexity and variation.
    2. **Detailed Drum Patterns**: Use EZdrummer to create detailed drum patterns and fills, then integrate them into Guitar Pro for a cohesive arrangement.
    3. **Effects Planning**: Decide where and when to use effects for vocals, guitars, and other instruments (distortion, delay, reverb, etc.).
    
    ### Additional Steps:
    
    1. **Lyrics**: Develop the lyrics to fit the vocal melodies and the overall theme of the song.
    2. **Harmony and Backing Vocals**: Add harmony lines and backing vocals to enhance the main vocal melody.
    3. **Dynamics and Articulation**: Add dynamic markings and articulations to the notation (e.g., crescendos, staccatos, accents) to convey the intended expression.
    4. **Review and Refine**: Listen to the whole song and make adjustments as needed. Ensure all parts work together cohesively and the song flows naturally.
    5. **Recording and Production**: If you plan to record the song, start planning the recording process, including the arrangement, mic placement, and production techniques.
#### Other notes 
    **Summary:**
    
    • **Song Concept & Inspiration**:
    
    The song inspired by the encounter on the train with the girl reading _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ is evolving into a deeper reflection on the replicant metaphor. It’s not just about the regret of not talking to her but touches on something more fundamental: the replicant’s desire to be truly seen, understood, and loved, specifically by the Blade Runner (the only one who can see the Replicant for what it is). The song will explore themes of artificial limitations, longing for connection, and the desire for peace through being known.
    
    • **Technological & Artistic Elements**:
    
    The concept of vectors in a vector database representing emotions was introduced as a way for the replicant to process emotions, much like how AI interacts with feelings. This led to the idea of incorporating a UNIX timestamp in the background of the song, representing how an android might record memories. (Possibly in a bridge or layer when main vocals are suspended.) These technological and emotional layers reflect the android’s experience of longing to connect while acknowledging the constraints of its artificial existence.
    
    • **Lyrics & Imagery**:
    
    The lyrics contain vivid imagery such as fog (symbolizing both the mask the user wears and an allusion to _Blade Runner_), steel monsters (representing urban machinery), and wires swaying like reeds. The forest of steel and concrete (樹海) contrasts natural and artificial elements, and the replicant’s limitations are reflected in counting “electric sheep” as a symbol of artificial dreaming. “Sterile lights” to represent the artificial operating-table like lights distinct from sunlight; comparing the society to an operating table or the train to a gurney might work. Mentioning the lack of sunlight might work well too.
    
    • **Structure & Musical Choices**:
    
    The musical composition is influenced by Radiohead’s simultaneous melodies, which were admired for their airy, clean sound. The user is experimenting with a call-and-response technique inspired by Bach to manage the complexity in their heavier music, ensuring the melodies don’t turn to “mush” amidst the harder sound.
    
    • **Future Plans**:
    
    The current song needs to be completed first, but after that, the user will be focused on creating this “Android” song, which they are very excited about. The song serves as a way to channel the “big feelings” they have, transforming them into something lasting and meaningful through music.
    
    **Metaphor References:**
    
    • **A thousand uncertain memories**: Refers to fragmented, unclear recollections, symbolizing the replicant’s struggle with imperfect memory or identity.
    
    • **Forest of steel and concrete (樹海)**: Represents the overwhelming urban environment, filled with artificial structures that mimic natural landscapes, symbolizing the blend of artificial and natural in the replicant’s world.
    
    • **The ground rumbling with the roar of mechanical monsters**: Evokes the sound and power of urban machinery, representing the dominance of artificiality over nature.
    
    • **荻 (Ogi)**: The reed imagery relates to fragility and the natural world, in contrast to the artificial environment. Wires swaying like reeds suggests the fluidity of artificial structures mimicking nature.
    
    • **A thousand lost memories that beg to be restored**: Symbolizes the replicant’s fragmented memory and its desire to recover or reconstruct lost aspects of its existence.
