* Use "Let ring" like *echoes* -- implying echoes of a memory, reverberating into the present
* Nostalgic chords and feeling -- a feeling that lingers, doesn't exactly resolve (until the end, that is)
### Concept

• **Song Concept**: The main character sits alone in a classroom, watching the rain, feeling a deep longing for someone whose identity and shared moments he cannot remember.

• **Absence as Proof**: The main character only remembers the emotional connection with a “her” and takes solace in knowing that the void left by her absence is proof of her existence.

• **Ambiguous Narrative**: The character’s longing is for someone whose existence he cannot prove, and can not be certain of, or for memories that may have never happened, but he believes in her presence, her existence, creating ambiguity for the listener.

• **Personal Experience**: I have personally felt this longing throughout their life, often tied to dreams. I question whether I am forgetting something from a dream or longing for a void.

• **Elf Girl Connection**: I relate this not unlike the type of dreams I have sometimes; recently I dreamt about an elf girl, who upon meeting I knew we understood each other at a deep emotional level, and felt a warm sense of trust, and who made me feel physically comfortable and displayed her trust in me as she allowed that proximity as I drew close to examine a map that she was holding. This  made me feel something I’ve never felt in real life. I worry that if I forget the dream, those feelings might return to haunt me. I have had many such dreams, but this one was the most poignant.

• **Ambiguity in Song**: User prefers not to reveal the full truth to the listener, leaving it ambiguous, while focusing on how the main character finds solace in the void’s shape proving her past presence.

• **Song Title Consideration**: User is considering naming the song “Void” to reflect the emotional and conceptual theme of longing for something absent.


* Description

```
I have a concept for a song. And it's a very hard-to-describe song. The concept of the song is this. The main character, presumably the singer, playing the role of the main character, okay? Is sitting. Now, I'm going to describe the imagery, okay? Later, I can translate it into concrete scenes and stuff. I approach songs kind of like directing a movie. I just realized that. Anyway, so the first scene is, you know, main character is sitting, looking out the window. The rain is hitting the glass panes. He's alone in a classroom, you know, typical school classroom that they have here in Japan. There's nobody there. Nobody's there. He's alone in this particular world, in this particular scene. There's no explicit need to mention that he's alone. He's listening to the sounds of the rain, and the rain and the melancholy of that gray sky makes him yearn for someone, someone particular. However, he doesn't know who it is. He knows that it's a specific someone, but no matter how hard he tries to remember, he can't remember who it is. He tries to conjure up images in his mind, but they're all just blurry faces, blurry figures. Blurry figures. Voices that make no sound in particular, though he remembers how her words made him feel. Yes, he knows it is a her. That's all he knows. He's longing for whatever it is that they shared. He doesn't remember who it is, and he doesn't even remember anything about the times that he shared, that they shared. He doesn't know. He doesn't know anything, except the fact that he wants to connect to her, he wants to remember. He wants to connect to her, he wants to remember, but he can't. There's no clues. There's nothing for him to go by. All he can do is sit there and look up at the gray sky and barely, just barely remember that he felt something special, that he shared a special moment with this person who he can't even remember what that moment was, and he can't remember the person. However, he can feel the shape of her absence, and that's proof that she was there. And in realizing this, he smiles, knowing that even if he can't remember, he won't stop trying, but he knows that the shape of the void that she left is always within him. And that in itself is a way of remembering her presence by feeling the shape of her absence.
```


### Inspiration / References
* 嘘月ーヨルシカ: The mood of the atmosphere and the song structure I found to be similar to what I imagined for this song. The part 君の目を覚えていない is a melody similar to how I imagined the「あなたの形」part at the end of this song. I am quite shocked how the mood is so similar to what I wanted, so I must be conscious with how much I allow this song to influence me.
* ラストストロウ - 空白ごっこ ; the mood and subtle guitar usage around 1:40 is great; instrumentation is fantastic and something similar might be worth exploring for this concept.
* HYDE/Kaz (VAMPS, HYDE solo project) - Overall instrumentation, if I can approach something like this (yeah I did -- too well, so I had to change it completely)

#### Other Notes
* I will try to approach this song imagining if I'm Hyde sometimes and imagining if I'm Yorushika or any of the members thereof. I think that might give me inspiration or perspectives that I don't have within myself without, well, it's more of like a, what would this artist do? And I'll try to use that to guide me. Because my natural inclinations will come out within that.

* I want to write down the progression of this song so that I may record the info, and adjust where needed. So far:
	* Intro: C-Em7/A-Gsus2-C (repeats)
	* Verse: C/F-(Em,Em7,Emadd11)-C/F-G-D/G (repeats, but last repetition stays on Em,Emadd11, to go to the Prechorus aka Verse 2)
	* Prechorus (Verse 2): Em-C-Am-G-Em-C-Am9-Gsus2-Am9-Gsus-Am-Am-Am9
	* Chorus: Fsus2-Em7/G-C-A
	* Verse 3 (WIP): Gsus2 (I)-C7sus2 (IV)-D (V)-Em (VIm)
	* Chorus repeats
	* Outro (WIP, nothing here yet, but I expect to repeat the same patterns in the chorus but keep them going and going until I conclude somehow)
	**1. Intro**: I - iii - V - I
	**2. Verse**: IV - iii - IV - V - V/V
	**3. Prechorus (Verse 2)**: iii - I - vi - V, repeat, end on  vi - V - vi instead of V
	**4. Chorus**:
	- Guitar: **IV - V - V/V - I**
	- Piano: **IV - iii7 - I - V/vi**
	**5. Verse 3 (WIP)**: V - IV - V/V - vi
* The repetition at the final chorus of 不可逆的な命の肖像 (Am, I think) has a pattern like this: c/d/em7/g_b -> em7/c/d repeat -> em7->gc/d/em7/g_b -> em7/c/d repeat -> em7->g
	* In other words, chorus repeats (C-D-Em7-G/B) but then transitions into a repetition with some suspense/forward momentum before finally resolving into G. If I want some forward-momentum repetition at the end, this is a good technique to observe. Obviously my chords/sounds will be different but the underlying concept is such that you take the "forward-moving" part of the chorus and don't let it resolve (don't let it get to G)
* Piano NEEDS MORE "Jazzy" transitions -- not so much that it distracts from the vocal, but add "flavor" -- however, add this only after the vocal line is in there, because you don't want to "crowd" the song -- ギター（pfも）で全部満たそうとしない
* LYRICS NOTES:
	 * 強く執着するメンヘラ気質の主人公はわざと。ロマンチックだろうけど、どこかで引いてしまう。自分の経験をもっと極端に攻めたら、という例えばの話になっている。
	* (No real meaning behind switching between English and Japanese here, just what I felt was easier to convey the imagery at the time. I will use only Japanese for the final, or maybe a few lines of English.)
	* (I must not end this with the same last line as Season's Call by HYDE which is "Because I always feel you in me" -- the concept and its origin is totally different, and not intended to plagiarize, so I must be careful to keep a distinction, even though that final sentiment is probably equivalent)
	* (Old outro; kept as reference) I don't remember the sound of your voice, but I imagine it sounds like a gentle wind that caresses my cheek. I don't remember the warmth of your touch, but I know that it feels like the warmth of a fireplace in the dead of winter. I don't know what to say when I call out your name, but I know that you're never far. You're right here inside of me. This hole, this void within me is in the shape of you. あなたの形。I will say it in Japanese or something, because Shape of You is a popular pop song that has absolutely nothing to do with this, and I don't want it to overlap in search results or anything But most importantly I hate that song because it is so shallow.
		* And I know that you live on, inside the shape of the void inside of me
	* The bridge is the most important part of the whole song -- even more than the chorus. It's the turning point (ビートが変わる瞬間) where the main character proves to himself that she exists -- he searches for where she is, or how to know her, and he finds out: even if that proof is a bit desperate
		* Notes about the Bridge:
			* The bridge captures both the character's intense yearning and the way he interprets his loneliness as proof of her past presence. The phrase "失うことが一度 / 見つかったことがあるから" suggests a kind of circular logic: he’s using the very feeling of loss as evidence of something once gained. This reasoning implies a sort of desperation—an almost obsessive need to validate her existence through his own emotional void. 
			* The hint of possible delusion is subtly woven in. For a casual listener, it reads as a bittersweet acceptance; for someone delving deeper, it reveals the main character’s reliance on his feelings as the only “proof” she was ever there. The interpretation that he might be creating meaning to cope with his loneliness could emerge during a closer lyrical analysis, especially with lines like "孤独を感じること / 側に居た証明なんだ," which invite the listener to question whether he’s grasping at an imagined connection. 
			* This layered ambiguity feels very intentional and adds depth, allowing different levels of interpretation without sacrificing the song's primary emotional impact.
			* 聞き流してるとなとなく「居ないことが寂しい、そのできた空白の痛みを感じて傷口ごと愛しくなったんだね！」と表面的に感じ取れるけど、実際はそうじゃないんだよね…無理矢理に存在証明を作り上げようとしている、自分を納得させるために。少し狂気で執着が潜んでいる言葉。
				* ここだけは変更したくないかな、曲の軸となっているから
* ゴミ箱 
	* それでも、your warm smile bathed in the 宵月 is a refuge (use metaphor? __ を溶かす , 安定剤のような, warm from the freezing world -- maybe borrow or take やがて凍りつく世界を眺める etc.) that I cannot forget
		* e.g. やがて凍りつく世界でも温かく包む宵月を浴びた微笑み
