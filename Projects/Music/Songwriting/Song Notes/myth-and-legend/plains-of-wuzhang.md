* About the death of Zhuge Liang
* This MUST have a fusion of rock. But it must not be hard rock. It must be flowing, gentle, like the spirit of Zhuge Liang returning to his peaceful home before he joined Liu Bei, imagining that everyone he loved was waiting there for him.
	* Like the sounds of the brook that flowed nearby.
