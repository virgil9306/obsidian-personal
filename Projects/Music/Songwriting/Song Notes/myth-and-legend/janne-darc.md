* Emphasize purity, maiden, virgin, beauty
* Foreshadowing (prophecy of Merlin)
* Emphasize her loneliness with the secret she kept
* Her resolve (the invasion of her village)
	* Inner strength
* Support and love of those around her
* Heavenly mandate
* Regality (the crowning of King Charles)
* Betrayal
* Trial
* Burned alive
* Fade out: that purity is still at her core, and she persists as a saint, is vindicated eventually, but... she is gone by then
