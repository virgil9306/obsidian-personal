Piano as a "planning" instrument (NOT guitar):

1. **Conceptualize the Song:**
    
    - Define the main idea or message of the song.
2. **Map the Journey:**
    
    - Outline the emotional journey and sections (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.).
3. **Assign Moods to Each Section:**
    
    - Determine the mood or emotional tone for each part of the journey.
4. **Plan Key & Key Changes on Piano:**
    
    - Use piano to experiment with key changes, focusing on outlining significant chord changes or melodic movements, independent of instrument-specific melodies.
    - Designate the primary chords for each section as reference points for other instruments and add notes for arrangement details.
5. **Create Chord Progressions (Numbered):**
    
    - Map out chord progressions with number identifiers to stay flexible, based on the reference chords and key changes planned on piano.
6. **Develop Motifs and Musical Ideas:**
    
    - Select distinct musical ideas that represent emotions or story elements. Establish motifs based on these ideas, designed to evolve and recur in varied forms throughout the song.
7. **Reharmonize and Add Color:**
    
    - Move beyond triads by adding extensions and using inversions for voice leading.
8. **Finalize and Add Detail:**
    
    - Refine sections, incorporating dynamics, rhythmic variations, and final touches.

#### Motifs

**Using Chord Changes as a foundation for Motifs**

Not the only choice, maybe you even want a motif before you compose, who knows, but, here is one approach

 1. **Identify Key Notes in Each Chord**:

- Pull out **important tones** from each chord (root, third, fifth) and use them as anchor points for the motif. For example, if your progression is **C → D → Em → G**, you could draw on **C, E, G** for **C major**, **D, F#, A** for **D major**, etc.

 2. **Create Melodic Movement with Chord Changes**:

- As each chord changes, let the motif follow a melodic line that highlights those chord tones. This could mean ascending, descending, or creating a pattern that loops across the chord changes.
- For example, if you want an ascending feel, you might go **C → D → E → G** to mirror the progression but add movement.

 3. **Syncopate or Rhythmically Alter the Motif**:

- Use rhythm to add personality to the motif. A syncopated or rhythmically distinctive pattern over the chord changes can keep it from feeling too “locked” into the chords, making it more memorable.

 4. **Introduce Chromatic or Passing Notes**:

- Adding passing tones or slight chromatic shifts between chord tones can create a smooth, connected feel. For instance, if moving from **C** to **D**, you could use a **C#** as a passing note, which adds a hint of tension that resolves nicely with the chord change.

 5. **Incorporate Repetition with Variation**:

- Using the same motif pattern but slightly altering it each time a new chord comes in can give it unity while adding interest. For example, you might repeat a **3-note pattern** based on the **I, IV, and V** chords, with small melodic adjustments each time.

### Lyrics

* Slant rhyming: Rhyme on the main vowel sound, not on the ending. Never on the ending. "Find" and "wind" may rhyme but "find" and "why" is better and rhymes on the long "i" vowel. This concept can be applied to Japanese too. ため息 and わからない or "wanna (feel/see)" rhyme.
* One part of "your" sound is switching languages between English/Japanese in the lyrics, to represent contrasting dipoles: for dialogue between characters, represent dissonance, struggle, countering viewpoints, internal conflict, or change. Each song will use this in its own way, but the fact that it is a different "character" or "viewpoint" or significant evolution will be consistent along all your songs. Otherwise don't change lyrics.
