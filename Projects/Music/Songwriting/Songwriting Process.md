## Songwriting Patterns

### Post-Rock
(My foundation will be based on post-rock even if it leans more towards rock)

#### Songwriting Checklist (Post-Rock x Kajiura Rock)
1. Establish the Core Theme & Motif
	- Create a **short motif** (melodic/harmonic) that represents the song’s theme.
	- Introduce it early, but **evolve it throughout** the song.
2. Map Emotional Checkpoints
	- Define the **journey**: What emotions must be explored before resolving the theme?
	- Example: **Hope → Despair → Struggle → Realization → Triumph → Resolution**
3. Structure with Through-Composition
	- **No strict looping**, **no predictable verse-chorus** cycles.
	- Each section **develops** rather than repeats identically.
	- **Reintroduce motifs differently** (new harmony, rhythm, instrumentation).
4. Manipulate Tension Nonlinearly
	- **Don’t just build tension upwards**—shift, dissolve, reframe.
	- Use **silence, harmonic shifts, unexpected dynamics** to create movement.
5. Balance Vocals & Instrumentation
	- **Vocals anchor structure** (rock-inspired phrasing & emotional delivery).
	- **Instrumentals drive the journey** (post-rock layering + Kajiura-style evolution).
	- Let **vocals & music interact dynamically**, not just follow pre-set sections.
6. Choose Resolution Style
	- **Final section reveals the theme**—either fully resolves or **dissolves into ambiguity**.
	- Return to motif **with new emotional weight**.
7. Adapt Balance for Each Song
	- Lean more **post-rock** for instrumental-heavy, crescendo-based pieces.
	- Lean more **Kajiura-style** for motif-driven, harmonically evolving compositions.
### Kajiura Structure
Based on analysis of *Sprinter* (my reference point), *Oblivious*, and *Seventh Heaven*

Notes on Kajiura's music
* Heavy use of Lydian (emphasis on 6度の音)
* One soundtrack (空の境界) has a motif that surfaces throughout (e.g. M01)
	* Even in *Sprinter* you can consider the main motif to be a variant of that original motif
	* This might give it a really nice consistent feel throughout
### Rock
Something like the following
* Intro
* Verse
* Chorus
* Verse
* (Bridge)
* Chorus
* (Verse)
* Outro

## General Songwriting Tips

Piano as a "planning" instrument (NOT guitar):

1. **Conceptualize the Song:**
    - Define the main idea or message of the song.
2. **Map the Journey:**
    - Outline the emotional journey and sections (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.).
3. **Assign Moods to Each Section:**
    - Determine the mood or emotional tone for each part of the journey.
4. **Plan Key & Key Changes on Piano:**
    - Use piano to experiment with key changes, focusing on outlining significant chord changes or melodic movements, independent of instrument-specific melodies.
    - Designate the primary chords for each section as reference points for other instruments and add notes for arrangement details.
5. **Create Chord Progressions (Numbered):**
    - Map out chord progressions with number identifiers to stay flexible, based on the reference chords and key changes planned on piano.
6. **Develop Motifs and Musical Ideas:**
    - Select distinct musical ideas that represent emotions or story elements. Establish motifs based on these ideas, designed to evolve and recur in varied forms throughout the song.
7. **Reharmonize and Add Color:**
    - Move beyond triads by adding extensions and using inversions for voice leading.
8. **Finalize and Add Detail:**
    - Refine sections, incorporating dynamics, rhythmic variations, and final touches.

#### Motifs

**Using Chord Changes as a foundation for Motifs**

Not the only choice, maybe you even want a motif before you compose, who knows, but, here is one approach

 1. **Identify Key Notes in Each Chord**:
	- Pull out **important tones** from each chord (root, third, fifth) and use them as anchor points for the motif. For example, if your progression is **C → D → Em → G**, you could draw on **C, E, G** for **C major**, **D, F#, A** for **D major**, etc.
 2. **Create Melodic Movement with Chord Changes**:
	- As each chord changes, let the motif follow a melodic line that highlights those chord tones. This could mean ascending, descending, or creating a pattern that loops across the chord changes.
	- For example, if you want an ascending feel, you might go **C → D → E → G** to mirror the progression but add movement.
3. Syncopate or Rhythmically Alter the Motif**:
	- Use rhythm to add personality to the motif. A syncopated or rhythmically distinctive pattern over the chord changes can keep it from feeling too “locked” into the chords, making it more memorable.
 4. **Introduce Chromatic or Passing Notes**:
	- Adding passing tones or slight chromatic shifts between chord tones can create a smooth, connected feel. For instance, if moving from **C** to **D**, you could use a **C#** as a passing note, which adds a hint of tension that resolves nicely with the chord change.
 5. **Incorporate Repetition with Variation**:
	- Using the same motif pattern but slightly altering it each time a new chord comes in can give it unity while adding interest. For example, you might repeat a **3-note pattern** based on the **I, IV, and V** chords, with small melodic adjustments each time.

### Lyrics

* Slant rhyming
	* Rhyme on the main vowel sound, not on the ending. Never on the ending.
		* "Find" and "wind" may rhyme but "find" and "why" is better and rhymes on the long "i" vowel. This concept can be applied to Japanese too.
			* ため息 and わからない or "wanna (feel/see)" slant rhyme.
* One part of "your" sound is switching languages between English/Japanese in the lyrics, to represent contrasting dipoles
	* for dialogue between characters, represent dissonance, struggle, countering viewpoints, internal conflict, or change.
	* Each song will use this in its own way, but the fact that it is a different "character" or "viewpoint" or significant evolution will be consistent along all your songs.
		* Otherwise don't change lyrics.
	* Exception: When using a shift for local emphasis like *italics* are used
