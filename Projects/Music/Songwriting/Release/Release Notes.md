### Release Strategy and Song Selection

1. Finish your songs
2. Ask a producer which songs you think are worth getting their professional touch
3. Invest in them to make those songs
4. Release those songs
5. Invest heavily in promoting those songs (advertisements, merch, releases, streams and stuff to promote your brand and promote the releases)
6. Use that revenue to make more songs and work again with producers
7. Rinse and repeat

### Physical Media Release Notes

* Physical releases should be special.
* The important part about physical releases used to be about 儀式 ceremony.
	* Put aside time to go to the shop
	* Pick out the CD or vinyl and purchase it in anticipation
	* Open it, check the artwork and booklets etc.
	* Set aside time to listen, and focus on listening (being present to live in the moment)
	* Manually put the disc in the player (put the needle on the disc etc.) and ensure  your sound system is set up
	* Listen, perhaps whilst looking at the lyrics on the booklet etc.
* To recreate the specialness of each song, I want to take photos and enclose photos, 1 for each song, encouraging listeners to imagine themselves in the scenery depicted -- what do they see, hear, smell, taste, and feel when they look at the photo? When they listen to the song while looking at the photo?
	* That needs to be economically sustainable. Here are some places to print such photos

	* Such photos should be shot on a low-resolution old digital camera

### Videos

* Use old digital camcorders from the 90's - 2000's.
	* Part of my concept is supposed to evoke emotions of "sentimental" moments and experiences. The images from these older sensors evokes that well because of their relatively low-fidelity, which appear blurry like memories when we recall them.
