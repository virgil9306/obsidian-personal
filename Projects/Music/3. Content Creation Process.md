### "Process" videos (停止)
Once a month make videos of the following so you can post regularly with your originals in the background

1. Performing your music
2. Sitting at your studio desk
3. Adjusting your gear
4. Pouring coffee in your studio
5. Writing lyrics on paper
6. Putting on your headphones
7. Scrolling through your DAW project or sheets
8. Nodding your head or grooving to your track
9. Listening to your song in the car
10. Day/night shots in the studio (time lapse-esque)
11. Shots from every angle of the studio
12. Close up and long-range shots of you
13. Listening/performing music outdoors (same as 9)
14. People listening to your music (?)
15. You setting up your gear
### Covers, Short Videos (一時中止)
(Both covers and snapshots of original songs can use the below format)

Summary:

1. Sing the songs with the original track as a backing track. Save these vocals
2. For those songs that you CAN sing, continue to pipeline them

Then create the plan of the song

1. Choose Song and Plan the Cover Version
    - Select the song and decide which sections you’ll include in the cover.
    - Cut down or rework the song if needed, creating a backing track to match your desired structure.
	
2. Storyboard the Video in Editing Software
    - Use software like Final Cut Pro or DaVinci to outline each scene.
    - Insert placeholder images to represent expected visuals (e.g., a person singing or playing guitar) with approximations of angles and framing.
    - Decide on single or multiple camera angles, depending on whether it’s vocal-only, guitar-only, or both.
	
3. Prepare and Time Scene Cuts
    - Organize all scene cuts to align with the backing track, ensuring smooth transitions.
    - Save this storyboard as a video template for future recording.
	
4. Build a Backlog of Templates
    - Repeat this process for multiple songs, creating a library of pre-edited video templates.
	
5. Record and Fill in the Performance
    - When you’re ready to record, follow the storyboard template, filling in your singing and/or guitar parts.
    - Adjust final timing and any minor edits, but most of the work will already be done.
