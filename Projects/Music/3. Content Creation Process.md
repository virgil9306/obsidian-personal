### Covers, Short Videos

(Both covers and snapshots of original songs can use the below format)

1. Choose Song and Plan the Cover Version
    - Select the song and decide which sections you’ll include in the cover.
    - Cut down or rework the song if needed, creating a backing track to match your desired structure.
	
2. Storyboard the Video in Editing Software
    - Use software like Final Cut Pro or DaVinci to outline each scene.
    - Insert placeholder images to represent expected visuals (e.g., a person singing or playing guitar) with approximations of angles and framing.
    - Decide on single or multiple camera angles, depending on whether it’s vocal-only, guitar-only, or both.
	
3. Prepare and Time Scene Cuts
    - Organize all scene cuts to align with the backing track, ensuring smooth transitions.
    - Save this storyboard as a video template for future recording.
	
4. Build a Backlog of Templates
    - Repeat this process for multiple songs, creating a library of pre-edited video templates.
	
5. Record and Fill in the Performance
    - When you’re ready to record, follow the storyboard template, filling in your singing and/or guitar parts.
    - Adjust final timing and any minor edits, but most of the work will already be done.
