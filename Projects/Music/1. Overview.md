#### **Branding Strategy:**

1. **Mystery & Intrigue:**

• **Objective:** Create curiosity by not fully revealing your face, similar to セツコ（空白ごっこ）

• **Reason:** Builds intrigue and a sense of exclusivity, giving the audience more incentive to attend live shows or follow closely for potential reveals.

2. **Consistent Streaming Presence:**

• **Objective:** Stream regularly, ideally 30 minutes daily, even if it’s just talking or interacting.

• **Reason:** Helps build a loyal, engaged following who feel personally connected and invested in your journey.

3. **Authenticity & Artistry Focus:**

• **Objective:** Let the music and the message speak louder than the persona.

• **Reason:** Focusing on your music’s quality and message helps you stand out from other musicians who might overly rely on image.

2. **Systemized Skill Development:**

• **Objective:** Schedule regular vocal and guitar practice, both technical and for repertoire.

• **Reason:** Continuous improvement of skills is essential for higher performance quality and more engaging content.

3. **Buffer Days for Flexibility:**

• **Objective:** Use Saturday and Sunday as flexible buffer days to catch up on missed tasks or plan for the next week.

• **Reason:** Allows for completion of tasks without stress or cognitive overload, creating space for adaptation when needed.

4. **Streaming & Preparation:**

• **Objective:** Stream consistently in the evenings (30 minutes) with 30 minutes for setup.

• **Reason:** Helps build engagement at times when your audience is available, without overwhelming your schedule.
#### **Summary:**
