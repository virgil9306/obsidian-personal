#### My songwriting process
(Cleaned up by ChatGPT)
    
    ### Overall Structure:
    
    1. **Concept and Flow**: Determine the overall structure and flow of the song, including how the story progresses or the message gets transmitted.
    
    ### Initial Composition:
    
    1. **Chords for Rhythm Guitar**: Establish the basic chord progression for the rhythm guitar.
    2. **Chord Changes**: Ensure smooth transitions between chords.
    3. **Strumming Patterns**: Develop the strumming patterns for the rhythm guitar.
    4. **Drum Plan**: Write down where you want different drum patterns and fills, using EZdrummer later to flesh them out.
    5. **Basic Bass Line**: Create a basic bass line following the root notes of the chords.
    
    ### Song Flesh-Out:
    
    1. **Melody Line for Lead Guitar**: Develop the melody lines for the lead guitar in bridges, verses, and motifs. 6.5. **Keyboard Parts**: Add keyboard chords, melodies, arpeggios, etc., to complement the guitar parts and add depth.
    2. **Vocal Structure**: Outline the basic vocal structure, focusing on the notes and overall melody without lyrics yet.
    3. **Guitar Solo**: Plan and write the guitar solo if the song includes one.
    
    ### Refinement:
    
    1. **Advanced Bass Line**: Flesh out the bass line, adding more complexity and variation.
    2. **Detailed Drum Patterns**: Use EZdrummer to create detailed drum patterns and fills, then integrate them into Guitar Pro for a cohesive arrangement.
    3. **Effects Planning**: Decide where and when to use effects for vocals, guitars, and other instruments (distortion, delay, reverb, etc.).
    
    ### Additional Steps:
    
    1. **Lyrics**: Develop the lyrics to fit the vocal melodies and the overall theme of the song.
    2. **Harmony and Backing Vocals**: Add harmony lines and backing vocals to enhance the main vocal melody.
    3. **Dynamics and Articulation**: Add dynamic markings and articulations to the notation (e.g., crescendos, staccatos, accents) to convey the intended expression.
    4. **Review and Refine**: Listen to the whole song and make adjustments as needed. Ensure all parts work together cohesively and the song flows naturally.
    5. **Recording and Production**: If you plan to record the song, start planning the recording process, including the arrangement, mic placement, and production techniques.
